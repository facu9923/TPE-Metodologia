#Software Architecture Document

##1.	Introduction
>[The introduction of the Software Architecture Document provides an overview of the entire Software Architecture Document. It includes the purpose, scope, definitions, acronyms, abbreviations, references, and overview of the Software Architecture Document.]

####1.1. Purpose
This document provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the system, using a number of different architectural views to depict different aspects of the system. It is intended to capture and convey the significant architectural decisions which have been made on the system.
>[This section defines the role or purpose of the Software Architecture Document, in the overall project documentation, and briefly describes the structure of the document. The specific audiences for the document is identified, with an indication of how they are expected to use the document.]

####1.2. Scope
>[A brief description of what the Software Architecture Document applies to; what is affected or influenced by this document.]

####1.3. References
>[This subsection provides a complete list of all documents referenced elsewhere in the Software Architecture Document. Identify each document by title, report number (if applicable), date, and publishing organization. Specify the sources from which the references can be obtained. This information may be provided by reference to an appendix or to another document.]

####1.5. Overview
>[This subsection describes what the rest of the Software Architecture Document contains and explains how the Software Architecture Document is organized.]

##2. Use-Case Diagram
>[This section lists use cases or scenarios from the use-case model if they represent some significant, central functionality of the final system, or if they have a large architectural coverageâ€”they exercise many architectural elements or if they stress or illustrate a specific, delicate point of the architecture.]

##3. Structural Diagrams

####3.1. Overview
>[This subsection describes the overall decomposition of the structural model]

####3.2. Class Diagram
>[For each significant class in the package, include its name, brief description, and, optionally, a description of some of its major responsibilities, operations, and attributes.]

####3.3. Packages Diagram
>[This section describes the system's decomposition into packages.]

####3.4. Deployment Diagram
>[This section describes the configuration of run-time processing nodes and the components that live on them.]

##4. Behavioral View 

####4.1. Overview
>[This subsection describes the overall decomposition of the behavioral model]

####4.2. Activity Diagrams
>[This subsection shows the computational activities involved in performing a calculation]

####4.3. Analysis Interaction Diagrams
>[This subsection describes sequences of messages exchanges among roles that implement behavior of a system on analysis.]

####4.4. Collaboration Diagrams
>[This subsection describes sequences of messages exchanges among roles that implement behavior of a system.]

####4.5. Sequence Diagrams
>[This subsection describes sequences of messages exchanges among roles that implement behavior of a system.]
